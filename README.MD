# Horrible Goose Badge

[@Gnarflordius](https://twitter.com/Gnarflordius) made a KiCad footprint of the Horrible Goose so I turned it into a capacitative-touch circuit that can be hooked up to the microcontroller of your choice. There is a demo Arduino sketch provided (it might only work on ATmega328 boards, but I'm not sure)

A few notes on the circuit itself:
1. The connector follows the [Shitty Add-On v1.69bis]() pinout. GPIO1 is the HONK pin; GPIO2 is the SYNC pin (tied to ground by default).
1. The HONK pin goes high when it detects a touch.
1. The SYNC pin is default tied to GND. You have to cut the jumper bridge if you want to use a different SYNC option.
1. <s>The [SOT-23-6 AT42QT1011](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/AT42QT1011) is out of stock everywhere. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯</s> LCSC has a bunch in stock as of August 22 2021, I don't see any other sites with stock.
1. If you want to use the UDFN-8 version of the AT42QT1011, the schematic for that is [in a different branch](https://github.com/heyspacebuck/kicad_goose/tree/8-udfn).

A few notes on the KiCad project:
1. gnarf's original footprint is located in the base directory as `honk.kicad_mod`, it was built with KiCad Nightly and isn't compatible with 5.1.10, the latest stable version.
1. Inside the folder `goose.pretty` are three footprints that _are_ compatible with KiCad 5.1.10, because that's the one I use: `honk_compat` which is a faithful recreation of the original; `honk_captouch` which adds a copper pour under the goose body, for cap-touch purposes; and `honk_captouch_scaled`, which makes the footprint bigger.
1. Inside `goose.lib` is a schematic symbol for the goose, and also a schematic symbol "R_Goose" where the goose is stealing a resistor instead of wielding a knife.
